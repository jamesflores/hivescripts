Playing around with coding stuff for Hive blockchain

Following are Jupyter Notebooks:
* FindUsers.ipynb - Queries for people based on various search terms in their location. Requires HiveSQL login details in pw.txt (not included here).
* activeuser.ipynb - Generates lists of active users based on those in users.txt.
* coingecko.ipynb - Queries price data from Coingecko
* bot.ipynb - Simple bot to look for certain tags and leave a comment/vote. For now looks for typos of proofofbrain
